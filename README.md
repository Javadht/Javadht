- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Javadht
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working with numbers.
- ðŸŒ± Nowadayas I'm focusing on my own projects; some excersices on social and public related metrics, such as unemployment rate, poverty, income, expenditures and many more studies which can observe and evaluate how people's life is going on, in response to universal sufferages!)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Probably easiest way is to copy @javadht and paste it in [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org)
